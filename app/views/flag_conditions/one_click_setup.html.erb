<h3>Autoflagging: one-click setup</h3>
<p>If you don't want to run through setting autoflagging up yourself, you can use this wizard to set it up for you.</p>
<p>When you click the button below, metasmoke will create settings for you with the default values where possible, or
  otherwise reasonable assumptions. That means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will have one flag condition set up to 280/1/1, the default setting, with an accuracy of 99.98%.</li>
  <li>You will have one preference set up to use 7 of your flags maximum per-site.</li>
  <li class="text-danger"><strong>Flagging in your name will be enabled.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can still change these settings manually after they've been created.</p>

      <strong class="text-danger">Warning:</strong> standard disclaimers apply. By using this wizard, you are explicitly consenting to
      your Stack Exchange account being used to cast flags automatically based on data collected by SmokeDetector. While we believe this has a high
      rate of accuracy and have designed the system to reflect this, flags cast using your account are your responsibility, and many invalid flags
      can in some cases result in your SE account being suspended. Only use this wizard if you are happy with this responsibility.
