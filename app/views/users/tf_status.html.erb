<h3>Two-factor authentication</h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication adds another layer of security to your account by requiring you to get a code from an app
  on your phone before you can log in. This prevents anyone who doesn't have your phone with them getting into your account.</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication is currently <strong><%= current_user.enabled_2fa ? 'on' : 'off' %></strong> for your account.</p>

<% if current_user.enabled_2fa %>
  <p><%= link_to 'Turn off', url_for(controller: :users, action: :disable_code) %></p>
<% else %>
  <p><%= link_to 'Turn on', url_for(controller: :users, action: :enable_2fa), method: :post %></p>
<% end %>
