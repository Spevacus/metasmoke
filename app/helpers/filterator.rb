    # I'm fairly sure most of this class works by magic, rather than by any design.

    # This thing turns strings of characters into strings of binary digits, where the binary digits come from the
    # character ordinals of each character in the string.
    # For each character, convert its ordinal to binary, pad the result with 0's so it's 8 digits long, and append the
    # 8 digits generated to an array; that array gets joined into one long string, which is what actually gets stored in
    # this hash.

    # This takes a Base64-encoded filter string and turns it into an array of database-level qualified database column
    # names.
    # Uses @generator to turn the decoded Base64 into a binary string; turns the string into an array of 0's and 1's,
    # and zips the result together with the API field mappings in config. Selects only the fields that now have a 1 next
    # to them, and returns the resulting list of field names.

    # This is precisely the opposite of the previous method: given a list of database-level qualified column names, turns
    # them into a Base64-encoded filter string.
    # Creates an array the length of the API field mappings in config, and populates it - for each index, if the field at
    # that index in the mappings is present in the list of fields passed to this method, the array will be populated with
    # a 1; 0 if not. Chops the array into groups of 8, parses each group of 8 as a binary number to turn it to decimal,
    # and then turns the decimals into their respective characters. Finally, Base64 encodes the lot and returns it.
